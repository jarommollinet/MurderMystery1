  <p>This past week, Juicy Jarom won the Leonardo da Vinci International Award. It's presumed that he, under accusation, stole the entire concept for his art piece from the work and presumed competitor: Scriptural Sydney. After Police and neighbors investigated her house, they found years worth of work leading up to her submission for the award and what might well be her most influential piece yet, but were even more surprised when they found that her work seemed to be the base for Jarom's most incredible piece yet: The Goliath. Question is, why did he do it, and what will Scriptural Sydney do next?</p>
